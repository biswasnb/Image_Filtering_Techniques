# Image_Filtering_Techniques

This project demonstrates the application and effect of three popular image processing filters on digital images:

- **Gaussian Filter** – for noise reduction and smoothing  
- **Sobel Filter** – for edge detection  
- **Median Filter** – for removing salt-and-pepper noise

---

## Aim

To apply and analyze the effects of **Gaussian**, **Sobel**, and **Median** filters on digital images, demonstrating their roles in noise reduction, edge detection, and noise removal respectively.
